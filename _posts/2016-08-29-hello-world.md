Hello World! 

I have an announcement everyone. I will be going to Europe in two weeks for a whole month with my cousin, so I have decided to become a blogger. I will set foot in Amsterdam, Netherlands on September 8th and leave Europe from Oslo, Norway on October 5th. This blog will be a mix of travel stories, equipment review, and an update of my latest photographs. Please follow along and SHARE with anyone who you might think is interested.

Thank you.

P.S. Don't worry my next post, and those that follow will be more exiting I promise. :P
